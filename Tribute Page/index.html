      <h3>Here's a time line of Elon Musk's life:</h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <div id="tribute-info">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1971</strong> - Born in Pretoria, South Africa</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1989</strong> - At age of 17, Elon Musk moved to Canada to
            attend Queen's University, avoiding mandatory service in the South
            African military.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong> - He left to study business and physics at the
            University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with an undergraduate
            degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor's degree in
            physics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1995</strong> - After leaving Penn, Elon Musk headed to
            Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics.
            However, his move coincided with the Internet boom, and he dropped
            out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it,
            launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999</strong> - co-founded X.com, an online financial
            services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the
            sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged with
            Confinity,[48][51] which had a money-transfer service called PayPal.
            The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed
            PayPal in 2001.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2000</strong> - Musk was ousted from his role as CEO due to
            disagreements with other company leadership. In October 2002, PayPal
            was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk
            received US$165 million.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2002</strong> - With US$100 million of his early fortune,
            Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, with the
            long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2012</strong> - The SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the
            ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and
            berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2015</strong> - SpaceX successfully landed the first stage
            of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad. This was the first time
            in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is
            a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of
            access to space.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> - SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon
            Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built (after Saturn
            V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket in operation as of
            2018. The inaugural mission carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to
            Musk as a dummy payload.
          </li>

        <h3>Ambition</h3>
        <p>
          Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of
          10. In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars'
          surface within 10â€“20 years. In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated
          that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of
          80,000.
